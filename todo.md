- how to delete a parameter lock for a step?

- re-trigger voice without click
- re-triggering when realtime recording steps (re-triggered by sequencer)
- voice muting
- multiple kits
- more samples
- multiple/switchable patterns (work on current one in a 'scratch pad')
- save state to/from JSON
- swing
- stutter
- sample player decay envelope - change all voices at once?
- pattern length - change all voices at once?
