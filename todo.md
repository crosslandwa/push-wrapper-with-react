- realtime sequence recording/parameter lock type behaviour. What I think....?
  - how to delete a parameter lock for a step?
  - decay per step
  - edit multiple steps at same time?

- more samples
  - some task to pull in non-version controlled audio assets from disk as part of build
- pan per voice/step
- voice volume/muting
- duplicate kit (hold duplicate, press kit select button, copies current kit to that kit)
- duplicate pattern (hold duplicate, press pattern select button, copies current pattern to that pattern)
- multiple/switchable patterns (work on current one in a 'scratch pad')
- save state to/from JSON
- swing
  - change it to switchable to 16n/8n
  - save as part of pattern?
- stutter
- change all voices at once?
  - sample player decay envelope
  - pattern length
- LCD is rendering on every step
