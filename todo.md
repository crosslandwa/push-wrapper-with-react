PITCH CONTROL
- realtime sequence recording/parameter lock type behaviour. What I think....?
- how to delete a parameter lock for a step?

- more samples
- edit the velocity for a given step
- realtime step record to nearest (rather than next) step
- investigate re-rendering (react PureComponent should help here!)
- multiple/switchable patterns (work on current one in a 'scratch pad')
- save state to/from JSON
- autosave/restore from webstorage API
- sample player decay envelope
- stutter

- pattern length (per voice?)
- bpm
- swing
