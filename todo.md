PITCH CONTROL
- realtime sequence recording/parameter lock type behaviour. What I think....?
- how to delete a parameter lock for a step?

- more samples
- pan per voice/step
- re-trigger voice without click
- voice muting
- duplicate kit (hold duplicate, press kit select button, copies current kit to that kit)
- duplicate pattern (hold duplicate, press pattern select button, copies current pattern to that pattern)
- multiple/switchable patterns (work on current one in a 'scratch pad')
- save state to/from JSON
- swing
- stutter
- sample player decay envelope - change all voices at once?
- decay per step
- pattern length - change all voices at once?
